//Theory 
1. 
Structured algoritm can be classified by this : declaration, initialization, processing of problem solving and finalization. In decalaration we declare the place
that we used for the function and the data, in initialization, we initialize with data to the place that we already reserve. In the process of problem solving is to write the algorithm 
to get the result. 
last is finalization which usuall consist of printing and end. 


2. The compiler is a software that used to change the program code (source code) into machine language (binary file) so it can be executed by the computer.
the program will be abe compiled if the program contains no error at all in its rules. Example in minGW built by GNU bundled by IDE.
